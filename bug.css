The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on different CSS values. However, if you make a mistake in the calculation such as an incorrect operator or missing parentheses, it may result in unexpected rendering or errors. For example, a common mistake is writing `width: calc(100% - 10px);` instead of `width: calc(100% - 10px);` which will lead to an unexpected result.  Another example is using an unsupported unit or mixing different units in calculations, such as `calc(100px + 1em)` which might not render correctly across different browsers.
