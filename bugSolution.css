The correct usage of `calc()` requires careful attention to syntax and unit consistency. Ensure that your operators are correct (+, -, *, /) and that parentheses are balanced. Always use the same unit type within the calculation, or ensure proper unit conversions.  For example, instead of `width: calc(100% - 10px);` , use `width: calc(100% - 10px);` and instead of mixing units, convert them to a common unit before calculation. Make sure that the calculation results in a valid CSS value.  Thorough testing across different browsers is recommended to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
